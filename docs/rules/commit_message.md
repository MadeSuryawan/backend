# Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the 50/72 rule.

## Rules

- **Subject line**: max 50 characters, imperative mood, summarizes the main change.
- **Body**: Only include a body if the change is complex. If included, use a blank line after the subject and wrap lines at 72 characters.
- **Focus**: Explain 'Why' the change was made rather than listing every file modified.
- **No Fluff**: Do not use 'Refactor:' or 'Feat:' prefixes unless I specifically ask for Conventional Commits.
